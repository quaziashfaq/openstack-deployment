# OpenStack Deployment

This document is just to track my progress. This is going to be heavily modified in the coming days.

I wanted to start with [Nova](https://www.openstack.org/software/releases/wallaby/components/nova). But it's dependent on 3 other components: 1. Keystone
2. Neutron
3. Glance


So I am starting with [Keystone](https://www.openstack.org/software/releases/wallaby/components/keystone)

I will use a VM to test it. OpenStack supports Ubuntu. 
So I have downloaded ubuntu-20.04.3.
I can install Ubuntu in Virtualbox or KVM. 
Let's try something new then.

## KVM installation
It's [here](./kvm.md)
